How do I start with wxAutoExcel?
---
(1) Follow the instructions in docs\install.txt.
(2) Check out the tutorial and then bundled samples to familiarize yourself 
    with wxAutoExcel, starting with the Minimal sample.
It is assumed you are familiar with VBA and Microsft Excel object model,
as wxAutoExcel is just its C++ wrapper.


Which licence is wxAutoExcel released under?
-------
wxAutoExcel uses wxWidgets licence (https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/master/docs/licence.txt).


Can I use wxAutoExcel without wxWidgets?
---
No, wxAutoExcel requires the rudimentary OLE Automation support 
as well as generic classes provided by wxWidgets.


Can I use wxAutoExcel to manipulate Microsfot Excel files 
on a computer without Microsoft Excel installed?
---
No, wxAutoExcel uses OLE Automation which requires MS Excel
to be installed and working properly.


wxWidgets is a multiplatfrom toolkit - can I use wxAutoExcel
to automate Microsoft Excel on OSX?
---
No, OLE Automation is available only on Microsoft Windows.


Which versions of Microsoft Excel are supported?
---
wxAutoExcel was initially developed along Microsoft Excel 2007. Generally speaking,
wxAutoExcel can be used at least with Excel 2003-2016. Obviously, one needs to be 
careful to use objects, methods, and properties available for installed 
Excel version. wxExcelApplication has a couple of version methods, such as
GetVersionAsDouble() or IsVersionAtLeast_(), it is also possible to obtain the 
list of properties and methods for a given object, see 
wxAutoExcelObject::GetPropertyAndMethodNames_().


Does wxAutoExcel support all features Microsoft Excel exposes?
---
No, it does not come even close, see the class list in the HTML 
documentation for what is available. Even when a class is listed there,
some of its methods or properties may not be implemented.
Events are not supported at all.


I have multiple versions of Microst Excel installed - can 
I chose which version to use for automation?
---
Unfortunately, this is not possible, 
see e.g. here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/292491


Is it possible to read from / write to a two-dimensional Range?
---
Yes, using wxVariantDataSafeArray, please see the BulkData sample.


How can I use wxAutoExcel with Microsoft Excel localized 
into languages other than English?
---
I suggest calling SetAutomationLCID_(wxExcelObject::lcidENnglishUS) on wxAutoExcel 
objects. The LCID is propagated towards the child wxAutoExcel objects, e.g.,
when you call it on wxExcelApplication, all of its properties like workbooks
will have the LCID set, all worksheets of the workbooks etc.
This way you can use English names of formulas, styles etc. regardless of
the language Microsoft Excel is localized into. This unfortunately does not
work in several cases such as formulas in conditional formatting and validation. 
MS Excel also seems getting worse at it, e.g., since version 2013 you cannot use
English NumberFormat string for TickLabels in charts. 
Be aware that the automation locale affects how the values (e.g. those
including decimal or thousand separators, formatted as dates etc.) are 
interpreted in MS Excel. E.g. "1,234" can be considered an integer if the 
locale's has "," as a thousand separator but also as "1.234" if "," is a 
decimal separator. 


How can I work with Excel objects not implemented in wxAutoExcel?
---
Unless you are willing to add their support to wxAutoExcel or can persuade me
to do that myself, you will have to resort to pure wxAutomationObject calls. 
The following example demonstrates a hypothetical situation where 
Worksheets object was not implemented by wxAutoExcel and you wanted 
to output the name of each worksheet in a workbook:

   // workbook must be a valid wxExcelWorkbook object
   wxAutomationObject worksheets;

    if ( !workbook.GetUnimplementedObject_(wxS("Worksheets"), worksheets) )
        return;
    
    long count = worksheets.GetProperty(wxS("Count"));            
    for ( long i = 1; i <= count; i++ )
    {
        wxAutomationObject worksheet;

        if ( wxExcelObject::GetUnimplementedCollectionItem_(worksheets, i, worksheet, true) )
        {            
            wxLogMessage(_("Name of the worksheet with index %ld is \"%s\"."), 
                i, (wxString)worksheet.GetProperty(wxS("Name")));        
        }    
    }   


It does not work?!

Please be always as specific as possible when reporting an issue.
If it is build-related, make sure you followed the install instructions.
Provide all information required to successfully resolve the issue, 
including the error messages.
Ïf your wxAutoExcel code does not work as expected, please:
(1) Make the shortest possible self-contained compilable example demonstrating 
    the issue, preferrably based on the most appropriate bundled sample.
(2) Create and test the VBA equivalent of the code from (1) to make sure the issue 
    is within wxAutoExcel and not your code or Microsoft Excel itself.
(3) Post the issue on wxWidgets forums (https://forums.wxwidgets.org) 
    or report it on GitHub (https://github.com/pbfordev/wxAutoExcel/issues).
