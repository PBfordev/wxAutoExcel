1 Installation
========================
The first step, is to download the source archive or clone the code
from GitHub and put it in any directory. If at all possible, please 
avoid a directory name with spaces in its name, as this can cause problems. 
In the following text this directory will be referred to as WXAUTOEXCELDIR. 


2 Building wxAutoExcel
========================

2.1 General notes
----------------------------------------------------------------
wxAutoExcel comes with support for building with CMake support. 
When building wxAutoExcel, it is assumed you have set the WXWIN 
system environment variable to the full path of wxWidgets, 
i.e., it contains a value such as c:\wxWidgets.

Before building wxAutoExcel, you can change some of its compile-time
settings in WXAUTOEXCELDIR\include\wx\wxAutoExcel_setup.h. These settings
are mostly useful if you don't plan to use some of wxAutoExcel features
such as Shapes or Charts and wish to minimize the size of the wxAutoExcel
(dynamic) library.


2.2 Building with CMake
----------------------------------------------------------------
CMake 3.1 or newer is required. As usual, an out-of-source build is strongly
recommended. wxAutoExcel can be built with Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW 
in Debug and/or Release configurations.

Common build options:
  wxAutoExcel_BUILD_SHARED: whether to build static (lib) or shared (dll) wxAutoExcel library.  
  wxAutoExcel_BUILD_LINK_WX_SHARED: whether to link to wxWidgets dynamically. When linking 
    dynamically, the wxWidgets_LIB_DIR CMake variable should be set to wxWidgets dll
    folder and not the lib folder.
  wxAutoExcel_BUILD_BUILD_SAMPLES: whether to build the included samples.
  wxAutoExcel_BUILD_USE_PRECOMPILED: whether to use precompiled headers (via cotire).
  wxAutoExcel_BUILD_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME: whether to link to the static CRT (and other compiler 
     runtime libraries). This setting must match the setting used when building wxWidgets
     (RUNTIME_LIBS etc.) and cannot be used when building wxAutoExcel in the shared mode
     or linking to wxWidgets dynamically.
  wxAutoExcel_BUILD_VENDOR: Short string identifying the library builder (used in DLL name).
     Defaults to "custom".

Static and import libraries will be built in the WXAUTOEXCEL-BULIDDIR/lib 
folder. Dynamic libraries and samples' executables will be built in the 
WXAUTOEXCEL-BULIDDIR/bin folder.

Library naming scheme
The names of import libraries include version and indication whether this is a Debug 
configuration (those have "d" after the version number).
The names of shared (DLL) libraries include more detailed version and provide also 
compiler, architecture, and Vendor identification. For example this is how the file 
names will look for Debug configuration of version 2.0.0 with Vendor set to default 
"custom".
For MSVC 2019 x64
    Import library: wxAutoExcel20d.lib
    DLL: wxAutoExcel200d_vc142_x64_custom.dll
For MinGW 8.1.0 x86
    Import library: libwxAutoExcel20d.a
    DLL: wxAutoExcel200d_gcc810_x32_custom.dll


2.3 Building with other compilers/IDEs
----------------------------------------------------------------
Create a new project just like you would for any other custom library
using wxWidgets. Add the desired build targets (Debug/Release, DLL Debug/DLL 
Release for Win32 and/or x64 ...). For each target you need to define (also) 
the following preprocessor definitions, such as these for Win32 builds:

Static debug:
__WXMSW__;__WXDEBUG__;_UNICODE

Static release:
NDEBUG;__WXMSW__;_UNICODE

DLL debug:
__WXMSW__;__WXDEBUG__;
_UNICODE; WXUSINGDLL; WXMAKINGDLL_WXAUTOEXCEL

DLL release:
NDEBUG;__WXMSW__;WXUSINGDLL;
_UNICODE; WXUSINGDLL; WXMAKINGDLL_WXAUTOEXCEL

Depending on the compiler/IDE you may need to add other compiler specific
defines.

The dynamic builds of wxAutoExcel need to link with wxWidgets's base 
(e.g., wxbase31u) and MSW core (e.g., wxmsw31u_core) libraries. 
Additionally, you should add these standard Windows libraries:
kernel32;user32;gdi32;comdlg32;winspool;shell32;ole32;oleaut32;uuid;advapi32;
comctl32;rpcrt4;wsock32;wininet;winmm;oleacc;shlwapi;version

2.4 Verifying the build
----------------------------------------------------------------
After successfully building wxAutoExcel library, build and run the Minimal sample 
to verify that your build works properly. 


3 Building applications using wxAutoExcel
=====================================

The project files shipped with wxAutoExcel / generated by CMake show which flags 
should be used when building applications using wxAutoExcel.

Independently of the compiler and IDE you are using you need to do the
following to use wxAutoExcel. In addition to the standard wxWidgets-related
and other settings, you need to: 
* Add WXAUTOEXCELDIR/include to the compiler include path.
* If you built wxAutoExcel with a provided MSVC solution, add   
  Add WXAUTOEXCEL-BUILDDIR/lib/ to the libraries path.
* If you are using the DLL build of wxAutoExcel, add "WXUSINGDLL_WXAUTOEXCEL"
  to the preprocessor definitions.
* Finally, add the wxAutoExcel library (such as wxAutoExcel20 for the Release 
  and wxAutoExcel20d for the Debug build of wxAutoExcel 2.0.x) to the list of 
  libraries to link with. Do not forget that all wxAutoExcel objects are declared 
  in wxAutoExcel namespace.
